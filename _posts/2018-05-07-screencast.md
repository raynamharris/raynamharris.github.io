## Screen casts for Data Commons

The Data Commons is implementing a process of schedule of deliveries
in the form of product demonstrations (or demos)
on a regular basis. 
We expect that many people will be hesitant to share and distribute 
videos or products of your unfinished or unpolished work.   

All I can say is that I hope you embrase the opportunity to 
receive useful feedback from diverse colleagues
and facility new collaborations.

To get you started, here is a suggested workflow:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wYoHMZ-pc0Q9gqPi96NsvsJzmm7nkwN-5P6keq6MqPE/edit#

Main steps:
- Step 1: Team Copper and coordinating Project Manager discuss
- Step 2: Deliverable delivered for internal Consortium review as GitHub pull request
- Step 3: Copper writes summaries of the product
- Step 4: Demo delivered to internal groups
- Step 5: Demo reviewed by NIH
- Step 6: Show demo live at in person meetings

## Need help?

Here is a nice [tutorial for screencasts](http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2016/12/04/how-to-record-a-presentation-screencast-video-using-quicktime/) by @vmbrasseur and another by [SeaGL](http://seagl.org/news/2017/09/29/for_speakers.html).

## What I hope to accomplish
The way I see it, on Day 0 of the DCPPC, each member of the consortium possessed a certain amount knowledge and experience working in computational and biological research. These people were group into cluster or K9 based on their shared domain knowledge or affiliation. After 180 day, we hope that suffience knowledge has been shred throughout the community that we know collectilly occupy a lot more knowlege space. This point is illustrated below.

## A collection of 80% done screen casts


If you are bored, here is a gallery of screen casts to watch for inspiration. 
I highly recommend watching all demos at 2x speed.
