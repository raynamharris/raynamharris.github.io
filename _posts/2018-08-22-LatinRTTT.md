### The early days
In 2016, I was introduced to Selene Fernandez-Valverde to discuss a Software Carpentry meets Spanish-speaking bioinformatics endeavor. Back then my Spanish was 8 years out of practice, and I was still learning to program.  I didn't think I had the expertise to teach programming in Spanish. Sue McClathcy had more expertise and practice, but its still difficult for a native English speaker to live translate a lesson from English to Spanish while live coding in from of a classroom. This observation led to two simultaneous efforts to 1) support a community-wide effort for collaborative lesson translation, and 2) provide instructor training for Spanish speaking instructors.  

### Spanish translations and instructor training workshops for Spanish instructors
In 2017, Sue and I traveled to Puerto Rico to instructor training in English that coincided with a [Data Carpentry Replicathon](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/845273652480425984) (hackathon for replicating scientific results). We conducted the course in English, but we chatting in Spanish over coffee breaks and at parties. It was very cool. We hosted a few virtual bilingual demos and discussions after the workshop and that was fun but lost momentum. Read more here.

In 2017, I went to Germany to attend OpenCon and worked on translating Software Carpentry lessons into Spanish with Paula Andrea Martinez. Our hackathon session has been immortalized in the [promotional materials for OpenCon2018](https://twitter.com/open_con/status/1006509708436561921). 

At OpenCon I met Juli Aranco from Buenos Aires, where I went on a 3 month post-PhD sabbatical. Juli helped me organize one lesson translation hackathon and the [Software Carpentry Workshop using those translated lessons](https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87/status/983071102523101185). During this time, I also co-taught Carpentry Maintainer training with Erin Becker, Jose, and Francois. I also [gave a talk](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/978814275497193472) an [RLadies Buenos Aires meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/) about The Carpentries and reproducible research with R in Spanish! I'm now pretty comfortable teaching programming and running meeting in Spanish. Now there are 3 stable Spanish lessons each with multiple bi-lingual maintainers. 

In 2018, I participated in two bilingual instructor training events. The first was about 5% bilingual. Sue taught a workshop at JAX with about 20 people, but I Zoomed in with two prominent figures from the Latin RLadies community who are practicing teaching the [R Gapminder Spanish lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder-es/). Laura Acion and Maria Florecia have already completed their instructor training! The 3 of are continuing to work together via RLadies Buenos Aires and the [LatinR conference](http://latin-r.com/cronograma/#session-25).


In August 2018, we taught a 25 person, [fully distributed online instructor training](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/1030828857929224192) with participants in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Educador, Mexico and Peru. Three co-trainers were located in Canada, the USA. Two co-trainers were located in the UK and Belgium but are native to Argentina and Bolivia. Zoom worked suprisingly well (with the exception of one user joining by phone), and [the etherpad supported a really bilingual mix of stories and notes](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/1030829866562793472). The first day, the instructors spoke completely in English. The students were encouraged to ask questions or make comments in either English or Spanish; their written responses were about 25% English 75% Spanish while  verbal responses were about the opposite. On Day 2 after lunch, Alejandra translated the "introduction to introductions" episode and taught that  in Spanish. It was great. I had her Spanish written text and her explanation, so I could talk in Spanish without mentally translating. This was easier than live-translating what Sue was teaching on day 1 with the English text and only my mental capacity and google translate. I was the lead instructor for last two episodes regarding The Carpentry [teaching practices](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/22-practices/index.html) and [operations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-carpentries/index.html), so I live translated those on the fly and delivered those lessons in Spanish with occasional help from the audience. I've already prepared a few slides and talks about the Carpentries in Spanish, so some of this was from memory. The final was a 20 min roundtable discussion about what everyone was excited about moving forward.  It's nice to have a face-to-face discussion and hear each other's voices when you've spent 12 hours typing your own thoughts and reading other peoples thoughts. Everyone has the same goal of organizing better training programs for their local data-literate communities.

### Summary and outlook

I think we've come a long way growing communities of people that are passionate about improving research and teaching all over the world. Everyone is enthusiastic, so the challenge now is to figure out who to work together to broaden our curricula and support workshops. This will be a long-term community project. 

I've come along way since this started. In 3 years my fluency in verbal and computing languages has grown. Having recently taught instructor training, this makes me reflect on two topics in the curriculum: growth mindset and grit. In 2015 I didn't think I was talented enough to teach programming in Spanish, but by early 2018 I had gained the experience and expertise necessary. It required some perseverance, but I didn't do it alone; many colleagues around the globe contributed support along to help turn some of these ideas into a reality
